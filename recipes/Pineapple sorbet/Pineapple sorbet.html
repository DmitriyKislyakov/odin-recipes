    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Beetroot and pineapple sorbet</strong></p>
    <p>
      The progenitor of sorbet is oriental sherbet â€” it is a thick dessert,
      which includes nuts and spices, held together with a soft fudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The delicacy came from Arab countries to Europe in the XVI century, where
      it underwent a number of changes. Firstly, the name began to be pronounced
      in a new way. A well-known variant of "sorbet" or "sorbet" appeared in
      France. Secondly, its consistency has changed- the resulting mixture has
      been frozen. And it began to turn out a light, melting delicacy in the
      mouth, which in the summer heat will be able to compete with ice cream.
