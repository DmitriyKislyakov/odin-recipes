    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Amaranth popcorn in a frying pan</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Amaranth is one of the oldest cereal crops, it was grown by the Inca,
      Aztec and Maya tribes 8 thousand years ago and used as a food and
      medicinal plant. They ate the seeds, leaves and roots of amaranth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suggest you make a very interesting recipe from this unique crop-
      popcorn. It turns out to be very tender and delicious.
    </p>
    <p>It can be used to make bars, desserts, add to salads or porridges.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Amarant cereal- 100g</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking steps:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <img src="images/step1.jpg" alt="step1" />
    <p>
      For this recipe, we only need amaranth groats. I didn't see it in local
      stores, so I ordered it on the marketplace.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>

    <p>
      The main success in cooking popcorn depends on the frying pan. Before you
      start cooking popcorn, you need to heat it up well. I did it over medium
      heat for about 5 minutes. There is no need to lubricate the pan with
      anything.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <img src="images/step3.jpg" alt="step3" />
    <p>
      Pour 1 tablespoon of grits into a hot frying pan without a slide. You
      definitely don't need to take more- you may not succeed. If you are
      afraid, you can start with 1 teaspoon.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>

    <p>
      After the grits are in the pan, cover it with a lid and start moving the
      pan for a few minutes. At this time, the amaranth begins to explode, like
      the corn popcorn we are used to. When the explosions have stopped, remove
      the lid and pour the resulting popcorn into a separate container to cool
      down.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>

    <p>
      Next, repeat the procedure: pour 1 tablespoon of amaranth into a hot
      frying pan, cover with a lid and mix the amaranth, moving the pan. Etc.
      Don't worry if you didn't succeed the first time. Perhaps you poured a lot
      of cereals or did not heat the pan enough. In the photo on the right is
      amaranth grits, and on the left is the resulting popcorn.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>

    <p>
      After the popcorn has cooled down, you can pour it into any container with
      a lid and store it in a dry place. You can use such popcorn in completely
      different dishes, which is enough for your imagination. I like to add to
      homemade granola or other desserts.
