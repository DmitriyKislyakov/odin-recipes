    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Homemade cheese curds in chocolate with protein.</strong></p>
    <p>
      I offer you a recipe for healthy cheese curds with chocolate flavor.
      Cheeses turn out to be dietary, so if you watch your figure and like
      sweets, this is for you. The taste is the same as that of store products,
      but as you can see, there is nothing superfluous in the composition!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also experiment with flavors by adding another protein or, for
      example, cocoa.
    </p>

      <li>Milk- 30 ml</li>
      <li>Curd- 400 g</li>
      <li>Protein- 100 g</li>
      <li>Dark chocolate- 80 g</li>
